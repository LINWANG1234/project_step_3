# Project Step 3: Data preparation

## Preparation

1. Reflect on the research problem and research statement you have developed.
2. Review your (developing) literature review and research statement to identify the data and dataset(s) that will be necessary to address your research problem and statement.
3. Review the importance of selecting research-aligned data ([Chapter 4, Blueprint](https://qtalr.github.io/book/part_2/4_research.html#sec-fr-blueprint) and [slides](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-09.html#/5/1)).
4. Review the concepts and strategies for implementing a data acquisition, curation, and transformation strategies [Part III (Chapters 5,6 and 7)](https://qtalr.github.io/book/part_3/) and slides [acquire](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-13.html#/), [curate](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-15.html#/), and [transform](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-16.html#/).

## Objectives

- Apply the concepts and strategies for implementing a data acquisition, curation, and transformation strategies to your research problem and statement.
- Develop a data preparation strategy that outlines the data and dataset(s) that will be necessary to address your research problem and statement.
- Reflect on the process of identifying a data preparation strategy.

## Instructions

### Getting started

*Make sure that you have forked and cloned the [`project_web`](https://github.com/lin-380-s24/project_web) repository from GitHub and that your Git and GitHub configuration is set up on your computer. See [recipe](https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/articles/recipe-4.html#check-your-understanding) and slides [Scaffolding research](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-10.html#/) and [Project orientation](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-11.html#/) for guidance.*

1. Open your research project repository in RStudio.
2. Open and modify the `reports/prospectus.qmd` as necessary to complete the steps below.

*Remember to use the edit, add, commit, push workflow to update your GitHub page.*

### Brainstorming

- What is the ideal data and ideal dataset(s) will be necessary to address your research problem and statement? Describe the data and dataset(s) in terms of their content, structure, and format.
- What are the available data and/ or datasets that (best) align with your idealized data and dataset(s)? Describe where there is alignment and misalignment. How will you address any misalignment?

### Draft a data preparation strategy

1. Develop a data preparation strategy that outlines the data and dataset(s) that will be necessary to address your research problem and statement. Your strategy should outline the acquisition, curation, and transformation of the data and dataset(s) and should address the following questions:

   - Select the best aligned data and/ or datasets (from your [brainstorming](#brainstorming)) and describe how you will curate and transform the data and dataset(s) to address your research problem and statement. A list of steps and a brief description of each step will suffice.

### Assessing your progress

1. Reflect on the process of identifying a data preparation strategy.

Some questions to consider:

- What did you learn?
- What did you find most/ least challenging?
- What resources did you consult?
- What questions or concerns do you have at this point?
- What do you need to address in order to move forward?

1. Consider how your prospectus is shaping up.

- How have your interests evolved?
- How have your research questions and objectives evolved?
- How have these changes been influenced by the literature you have reviewed and/ or the knowledge you have gained in this course?

## Submission

1. Use the necessary Quarto features to format your document (*e.g.*, headings, lists, links, citations, *etc.*).
2. Render your project (to HTML).
3. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
4. Create an Issue or Discussion post in your repository to share your progress and ask questions. Tag the instructor `@francojc` in your post.
